Recently, I decided to start saving useful links and videos, that I am going to watch or watched already. In order to do that I needed a place where I can store all these items. My first decision was [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/) with secret gists.
To interact with my gists, I found this snippet manager called [Lepton](https://github.com/hackjutsu/Lepton)

I used this tool for a while and I quite liked it, but there was one downside - lack of customization. I can't pick my preferred theme, I can't pick font style and etc. Obviously you can live without these features and I could. But I found an alternative which can handle all that - [Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/)
