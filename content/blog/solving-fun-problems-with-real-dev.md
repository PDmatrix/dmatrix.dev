Hello everyone! [ðŸ‘‹]{.emoji}

Today, I want to tell you about a cool project called [**Real Dev**](https://real.dev)

Real Dev is a platform for solving *real world-like* problems, for example, creating backend API for a frontend application and so on. It's a great way to sharpen your skills as a software developer. Also, it can be used to improve your portfolio! If you like to solve programming puzzles, but you tired of algorithms and math you will like this project. [ðŸ˜Š]{.emoji}

To solve problems you start with picking a task. For now, there are only ten tasks, but in the future, there will be much more. Every task has its level of complexity from *easy* to *hard*. 

There are currently two main languages to write:
- `Python`
- `JavaScript` (or `TypeScript`)

If it is not enough, you can use `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose`. This means, that you can write code in pretty much any programming language as long as you can run it via `docker`.

To get started, you need:

1) Register account on the [official website](https://real.dev)
2) Download and install the [CLI](https://real.dev/docs#cli-the-real-command)
3) Login via `CLI` using `real login`
4) [Pick a task](https://real.dev/tasks) and start solving it

I suggest you start with [Hello real world](https://real.dev/task/hello-real-world) task, as it helps you to get familiar with the whole process of submitting a task. After that, you can pick any task that you want and solve it using your *favorite programming language*.

I liked this experience. I am planning to continue solving tasks when new ones will come out. By far, my favorite task was [Host My Stuff](https://real.dev/task/host-my-stuff). At first, I thought that it is a very hard task and I doubted that I could solve it. But in the end, it was not that difficult. I encourage you to try solving all tasks on your own because doing that helps you practice a **problem-solving** skill.

Although this project in an early stage, it looks very promising and I am looking forward to its development!

P.S. I am very proud of fact that I am the first person that completed all of the tasks in three days. Here's picture of current leaderboard
