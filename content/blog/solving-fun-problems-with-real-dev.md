Hello everyone!

Today, I want to tell you about a cool project called **Real Dev**

Real Dev is a platform for solving *real world-like* problems, for example, creating backend api for a frontend application. It's a great way to ?sharpen? your skills as a software developer. It can be used to improve your portfolio.

If you like to solve programming puzzles, but you tired of algorithms and math you will like this project.

For now, there are only ten tasks, but in the future there will be much more. 

Every task has it's own level of complexity from easy to hard.

Great CLI to help you get started to code.

There are currently two main languages to write:
- Python
- JavaScript (or TypeScript)

If it is not enough, you can use `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose`. This means, that you can write code in pretty much any programming language as long as you can run it via `docker`.

This project in early stage, but it looks very promising.

To get started, you need:

1) Register account on the [official website](https://real.dev)
2) Download the [CLI](https://real.dev/docs#cli-the-real-command)
3) [Pick a task](https://real.dev/tasks) a start solving it

I suggest you to start with [Hello real world](https://real.dev/task/hello-real-world) task, as it helps you to get familiar with whole process of submitting a task. After that, you can pick any task that you want and solve it using your favorite programming language.

It's a great experience. I really liked it.
